## [CS20B-Final-Project]()
this is my final project for the course, it's a tui based chess game in java that can be played between two players.

most of the other folders are demonstrations of the skills we covered in each module of the course, including:
- [exception handling](ExceptionHandling)
- [matrices](MatrixStuff)
- [array lists](ArrayList)
- [inheritance](Inheritance)
- [interfaces](Interfaces)

## other folders
- [BP37]() contain answers to questions from chapter 37 of *Blue Pelican Java* by Charles E Cook
- [old]() is just an old version of the final project
